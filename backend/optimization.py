# Implement the optimization logic here
# Modify the code, optimize algorithms, improve data structures, parallelize and allocate resources based on identified bottlenecks and constraints

# Use the Sweep AI configuration to measure and evaluate performance metrics, code quality score, resource utilization metrics, scalability benchmarks, and aggregated issues for better decision-making

# Continuously monitor performance metrics and resource utilization to adapt optimization strategies based on observed results
