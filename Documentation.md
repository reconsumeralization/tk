## System Overview
The TeacherStudentParentAdminAi system is designed to enhance educational processes through features like auto-grading, chat, quizzes, tests, and personalized learning. The system has different user roles including Teacher, Student, Parent, Administrator, and AI Module, each with their unique functionalities.

## System Architecture

The system is built using a combination of Python/Flask for server-side logic, SQLAlchemy for database management, and a RESTful API for frontend communication. The frontend is built using React/TypeScript for a dynamic and responsive user interface, Redux for state management, and Axios for handling API requests. The AI features are implemented using Scikit-learn, a machine learning library for Python.

## AI Module

The AI module, defined in `ai_module.py` and `ai_features.py`, uses Hugging Face Transformers for natural language processing tasks such as lesson planning, personalized learning recommendations, and assessment feedback. Additionally, it uses Scikit-learn for data analysis and predictive modeling. The `DataAnalyzer` class in `ai_features.py` provides methods for analyzing data, training a linear regression model, and making predictions.

## API Endpoints

The system provides several API endpoints for managing users, courses, assignments, tests, and chats. These endpoints are defined in the `routes.py` file. All routes are protected with JWT authentication, except for the user creation route.

## AI Module
## Latest Updates

This section provides updates on the latest features, refactors, and tests added to the system. For a detailed changelog, please refer to the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

The AI module, defined in `ai_module.py`, uses Hugging Face Transformers for natural language processing tasks such as lesson planning, personalized learning recommendations, and assessment feedback.

## Testing

The system includes unit tests for server-side components, integration tests for API endpoints, security audit tests, and code quality tests. These tests are respectively defined in the `test_backend.py`, `security_audit_tests.py`, and `code_quality_tests.py` files. The frontend tests include unit tests for React components and integration tests for frontend services, defined in the `test_frontend.ts` file.

## Deployment

The system is packaged using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. The Dockerfile and Kubernetes configuration are included in the project files.

## Security

The system implements a number of security measures to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches. Enhancements include the addition of rate limiting, input validation, and encryption of sensitive data, as specified in the `TeachersAId` file. JWT authentication and role-based authorization are also in place.

The system uses JWT for secure user authentication and HTTPS for secure data transmission. These features are implemented in the `auth.py` and `encryption.py` files respectively.
## Latest Tests

This section provides updates on the latest tests added to the system. For a detailed test log, please refer to the `TESTLOG.md` file.
## Database Models

The database models are defined in the `models.py` file. The models include User, Course, UserCourse (a relationship table), Assignment, Test, and Chat.

## Disaster Recovery

The system has a robust disaster recovery plan in place, as outlined in the `disaster_recovery_plan.yml` file. This includes backup strategies, data replication, and detailed failover processes to ensure system reliability and minimize downtime in case of disasters.

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements include advanced AI features for predictive analytics and the development of mobile applications for Android and iOS.

For more information, please refer to the `ROADMAP.md` file.
## Using the AI Features

To use the AI features, you need to create an instance of the `DataAnalyzer` class and call its methods. Here is an example:

```python
from ai_features import DataAnalyzer
## Code Improvement Testing
- Run the `sweep_code_improver.py` script with test data.
- Verify that the script identifies areas for improvement and generates Sweep issues accurately.

# Create a DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'B': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
})

# Create a DataAnalyzer instance
analyzer = DataAnalyzer()

# Analyze the data
print(analyzer.analyze_data(data))

# Train a model
# Analyze the data
print(analyzer.analyze_data(data, 'A', 'B'))

# Train a model

# Make predictions
print(analyzer.predict_data(X))
```
# Train a model
X = data[['A']]
y = data['B']
print(analyzer.train_model(X, y, 'linear_regression'))

# Make predictions
print(analyzer.predict_data(X, 'linear_regression'))
