## System Overview
The TeacherStudentParentAdminAi system is designed to enhance educational processes through features like auto-grading, chat, quizzes, tests, and personalized learning. The system has different user roles including Teacher, Student, Parent, Administrator, and AI Module, each with their unique functionalities.

## System Architecture

The system is built using a combination of Python/Flask for server-side logic, SQLAlchemy for database management, and a RESTful API for frontend communication. The frontend is built using React/TypeScript for a dynamic and responsive user interface, Redux for state management, and Axios for handling API requests. The AI features are implemented using Scikit-learn, a machine learning library for Python.

## AI Module

The AI module, defined in `ai_module.py` and `ai_features.py`, uses Hugging Face Transformers for natural language processing tasks such as lesson planning, personalized learning recommendations, and assessment feedback. Additionally, it uses Scikit-learn for data analysis and predictive modeling. The `DataAnalyzer` class in `ai_features.py` provides methods for analyzing data, training a linear regression model, and making predictions.

## API Endpoints

The system provides several API endpoints for managing users, courses, assignments, tests, and chats. These endpoints are defined in the `routes.py` file. All routes are protected with JWT authentication, except for the user creation route.

## AI Module
## Latest Updates

This section provides updates on the latest features, refactors, and tests added to the system. For a detailed changelog, please refer to the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

The AI module, defined in `ai_module.py`, uses Hugging Face Transformers for natural language processing tasks such as lesson planning, personalized learning recommendations, and assessment feedback.

## Testing

## Metrics Collection

The Metrics Collection module, provided by the `MetricsCollector` class, allows for the collection of various metrics such as code quality, coverage, and performance. These metrics are vital for maintaining high code standards and identifying areas for improvement.

To collect code quality metrics, instantiate the `MetricsCollector` class and use the `collect_code_quality_metrics` method, passing the path to the codebase as an argument:

```python
from metrics_collector import MetricsCollector

# Create a MetricsCollector instance
metrics_collector = MetricsCollector()

# Collect code quality metrics
code_quality_metrics = metrics_collector.collect_code_quality_metrics('path/to/codebase')
# Output the collected metrics
print(code_quality_metrics)
```

Similarly, to collect coverage and performance metrics, use the `collect_coverage_metrics` and `collect_performance_metrics` methods accordingly:

```python
# Collect coverage metrics
coverage_metrics = metrics_collector.collect_coverage_metrics('path/to/codebase')
# Output the collected coverage metrics
print(coverage_metrics)

# Collect performance metrics
# Assume 'some_function' is the function to test, with its arguments
performance_metrics = metrics_collector.collect_performance_metrics(some_function, arg1, arg2)
# Output the collected performance metrics
print(performance_metrics)
```

The system includes unit tests for server-side components and integration tests for API endpoints. These tests are defined in the `test_backend.py` file. The frontend tests include unit tests for React components and integration tests for frontend services, defined in the `test_frontend.ts` file.

## Deployment

## CI/CD Integration

The `CICDIntegration` class enables the automation of Sweep issue generation within the CI/CD pipeline. It facilitates setting up the environment, integrating the analysis with the pipeline, and tearing down the environment post-analysis.

To automate the integration, instantiate the `CICDIntegration` class and call the `integrate_with_pipeline` method:

```python
from ci_cd_integration import CICDIntegration

# Create a CICDIntegration instance
integration = CICDIntegration()

# Integrate the Sweep AI analysis with the CI/CD pipeline
integration.integrate_with_pipeline()
```

Incorporating this step into your CI/CD pipeline ensures that each build triggers an analysis of the codebase, helping in the continuous improvement of code quality.

The system is packaged using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. The Dockerfile and Kubernetes configuration are included in the project files.

## Security

The system implements a number of security measures to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches. Enhancements include the addition of rate limiting, input validation, and encryption of sensitive data, as specified in the `TeachersAId` file. JWT authentication and role-based authorization are also in place.

The system uses JWT for secure user authentication and HTTPS for secure data transmission. These features are implemented in the `auth.py` and `encryption.py` files respectively.

A new script `security_audit.py` has been introduced to automate the security auditing process. It checks the code and infrastructure for common vulnerabilities to enhance the security posture. The output of this script includes a detailed report of findings and recommended actions.

The disaster recovery strategy is outlined in `disaster_recovery_plan.md`. It includes redundancy measures, data backup protocols, and failover procedures to ensure system resilience and high availability. Regular testing of the recovery processes is conducted to guarantee effective response to any incident.
## Latest Tests

This section provides updates on the latest tests added to the system. For a detailed test log, please refer to the `TESTLOG.md` file.
## Database Models

The database models are defined in the `models.py` file. The models include User, Course, UserCourse (a relationship table), Assignment, Test, and Chat.

## Disaster Recovery

The system has a robust disaster recovery plan in place, as outlined in the `disaster_recovery_plan.yml` file. This includes backup strategies, data replication, and detailed failover processes to ensure system reliability and minimize downtime in case of disasters.

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements include advanced AI features for predictive analytics and the development of mobile applications for Android and iOS.

For more information, please refer to the `ROADMAP.md` file.
## Using the AI Features

To use the AI features, you need to create an instance of the `DataAnalyzer` class and call its methods. Here is an example:

```python
from ai_features import DataAnalyzer
## Code Improvement Testing
- Run the `sweep_code_improver.py` script with test data.
- Verify that the script identifies areas for improvement and generates Sweep issues accurately.
